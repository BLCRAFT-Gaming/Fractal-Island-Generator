# Fractal-Island-Generator
This program creates a random island by continually making smaller changes to a previous island.
I read a book called Math Bytes, where it showed an algorithm to create a random fractal coastline. 
A few years ago, when I had limited coding experience, I tried making this on Scratch, but its capabilities were too limited. 
Now that I know Java, I decided to create this once and for all. 
This is the first project I have made for fun that I think is actually has some utility, and the first one to take 3 hours to create. 
I don't fully understand graphics: this project is mostly based on a template I was given in class.
The islands seem a bit off sometimes, so if you notice any improvements I could make, please say so.

==THINGS TO TWEAK==

There are some things you can experiment with in this program.
1. Height and width can be changed. They should be kept in a 1:1 ratio.
   If the height/width was changed, changing the startSquare is probably a good idea. You can even make it into a triangle or other polygon.
2. levelMax, coeffBase, and coeffExpo are quick and easy edits. Try changing them until you get the islands that look the best.
3. You could change some of the code itself while maintaining the same ideas from before. A few example include:
      Changing the number of midpoints taken. Perhaps a trisection.
      If you could somehow fix the way how sometimes the island crosses over itself, that would be great. (Like, when two lines from the polygon intersect.)
      Simulating an actual coastline by (hypothetically) having water chip away at certain parts of the island more than others.
      Messing around with colors.

Have fun.
